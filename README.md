# Python_VR_OculusriftExp
This script demonstrates the study of the exit choice behaviour of the
pedestrians by uisng VirtualReality and OcculusRift headset.
The banner uses a sequence helper to animate. Use the WASDQE keys to move
around. It has also need the extractml.py, lighting_virtual_env.py, 
pedestrian_allocation.py oculus_gamepad.py and find_methods.py files during compling.
###Software requirements: python and Vizard(Virtual reality)for conducting ecperiments 
and for Analysis(R and python)
Thesis pdf file is available at:

If OcculusRift is not available still the experiment can be done by comment the occulus
module, occulus_gamepad.py and vizconnect.go('oculus_gamepad.py')
